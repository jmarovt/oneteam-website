      <img src="../images/content/slack-business-platform/form-software.png" class="cover">
      
      <p>A lot of current business apps are just glorified HTML forms.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Let's look at some examples:</strong></p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Expense reporting software,</li>
      
        <li>Bug tracking software,</li>
      
        <li>Vacation tracking software,</li>
      
        <li>Time tracking software,</li>
      
        <li>Employee engagement software,</li>
      
        <li>and many more... </li>
      </ul>
      
      
      <p>As regular employees you probably use these kinds of apps once or twice a month. First we play the log-in-password jujitsu.
        You somehow manage to log in and then struggle to find the one thing you actually want to do. </p>
      
      <p>Finally you find the form and fill it in. Think about it - this step is the only one that actually matters.
        All the stuff before and around... is just waste.</p>
      
      <p>For people on the ground - for people that actually do the work - most non-business critical software is a burden.
        They want to get the work done. They don’t want to learn your new fancy UI. They don’t want to remember yet another login
        combo. </p>
      <hr>
      <h2 id="weareusingtoomuchsoftwareandyettoolittle">We are using too much software - Or maybe too little.</h2>
      
      <p>Every office worker has their core productivity software:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Photoshop/Sketch</strong>… if you’re a designer.</li>
      
        <li>
          <strong>CRM</strong>… if you’re a sales person.</li>
      
        <li>
          <strong>Code editor</strong>… if you’re a developer.</li>
      
        <li>
          <strong>Hubspot</strong>… if you’re a marketer.</li>
      
        <li>
          <strong>Text editor</strong>… if you’re a copywriter.</li>
      
        <li>
          <strong>Accounting software</strong>… if you’re in finance.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>You get my point. This software, obviously, needs UI.</p>
      
      <p>But if we carefully examine our month, we don’t interact with 2 or 3 business apps. If you’re like me, the number is closer to
        10.</p>
      
      <p>There’s nothing wrong with using many business applications. In fact, I believe we should be using even more software. If it
        augments us and lets us spend more time doing our core job - I’m all up for it.</p>
      
      <p>Which leads us to...</p>

      <h2 id="theriseofinvisiblesoftware">The rise of invisible software</h2>
      
      <p><strong>What is invisible software?</strong> It's software that asks me for input and displays some output… and then goes away. In some cases, I don’t even need to know
        it exists.</p>
      
      <p><strong>For example:</strong> I don’t need to love your expense reporting software. I happen to use it because I need to buy some stuff on
        behalf of my company. The expense software is in the middle and it helps me document the transaction.</p>
      
      <p>But I don’t need to love it. Maybe, I don’t even need to “touch” it. That's why, I believe, expense reporting software will soon run on close to zero touchpoints (for most users).</p>

      <p><strong>Let's look at how expense reporting will become invisible:</strong></p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>It will know when I purchased something. Automatically.</li>
      
        <li>It will receive an itemized receipt from the merchant. Automatically.</li>
      
        <li>It will know I was in a meeting with a billable client. So it will apply the expense to the client. In case it won’t know,
          it will ask me to "attach" a client. Semi-automatically.</li>
      
        <li>And then it will push everything to the accounting system. Automatically.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Zero-to-one touchpoint. Invisible software.</p>

      <h2 id="whyslackistheinvisibilitycloakforbusinesssoftware">Why Slack is the invisibility cloak for business software</h2>
      
      <p>I believe Slack is pulling us closer to the invisible software reality. Why is that?</p>
      
      <p>At its core, Slack is a simple communication tool: it enables you to talk to your colleagues either directly or via shared channels.</p>
      
      <p>But Slack is so much more:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Slack is ubiquitous:</strong> It’s probably the only software that everyone in the company uses on a daily basis.</li>
      
        <li>
          <strong>Slack is used on a daily basis:</strong> It’s the one software that people actually check. If you want people to see something - Slack is your
          best option.</li>
      
        <li>
          <strong>Slack has a notification system:</strong> It has a very reliable cross-device notification system.</li>
      
        <li>
          <strong>Slack has a developer ecosystem:</strong> It has a good set of tools and UI components available to developers. And they’re getting
          better fast.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Let’s go back to the invisibility theory. Looking at Slack through this prism it provides a platform to run &amp; interact with simple business apps. It has
        notifications, it has user presence and it has a canvas plus basic UI elements to interact with the user (when needed).</p>
      
      <p>This means that a simple business app that consists of standard HTML layout elements like forms can now run fully in
        Slack:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>✅ No front-end,</li>
        <li>✅ No new UI to learn,</li>
        <li>✅ No new accounts,</li>
        <li>✅ No e-mails.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Invisible app pings you whenever it needs some input. And it outputs information upon your request or whenever the context makes sense.
        </p>
      
      <p>The benefits of invisibility software approach are multifaceted:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Benefits for managers:</strong> get information from their workers that’s needed in a timely manner,</li>
      
        <li>
          <strong>Benefits for workers:</strong> can focus on their core job,</li>
      
        <li>
          <strong>Benefits for app developers:</strong> can focus on reducing the interaction with users (instead of increasing engagement as its often
          the case now)</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>The app (almost) goes away. And this is as close to invisibility as it gets.</p><p>Welcome to the future!</p>
