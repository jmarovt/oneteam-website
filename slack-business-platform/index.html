      <h1 id="whyslackisthebiggestupcomingbusinessplatform">Slack platform is a big deal</h1>
      
      <p>A lot of current business apps are just glorified HTML forms.</p>
      
      <p>Think about it:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Expense reporting software,</li>
      
        <li>Bug tracking software,</li>
      
        <li>Vacation tracking software,</li>
      
        <li>Time tracking software,</li>
      
        <li>Employee engagement software,</li>
      
        <li>and many more...</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>As a regular employee, you use these kinds of apps once or twice a month. You get used to play the log in/forgotten password jujitsu.
        You finally come in, struggle to find the one thing you need to do. </p>
      
      <p>Then finally, at last… you find the form &amp; fill it in. Think about it - this step is the one thing that actually matters.
        All the stuff before and around is just waste.</p>
      
      <p>Sure, waste that was necessary until now. But waste, nonetheless.</p>
      
      <p>For people on the ground - for people that actually do the work - most non-business critical software is just as a burden.
        They want to get the work done. They don’t want to learn your new fancy UI. They don’t want to remember yet another login
        combo. </p>
      <hr>
      <h2 id="weareusingtoomuchsoftwareandyettoolittle">We are using too much software - And yet too little.</h2>
      
      <p>Every office worker has their core productivity software. Software that lives constantly in one of her browser tabs.</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Photoshop/Sketch</strong>… if you’re a designer.</li>
      
        <li>
          <strong>CRM</strong>… if you’re a sales person.</li>
      
        <li>
          <strong>Code editor</strong>… if you’re a developer.</li>
      
        <li>
          <strong>Hubspot</strong>… if you’re a marketer.</li>
      
        <li>
          <strong>Text editor</strong>… if you’re a copywriter.</li>
      
        <li>
          <strong>Accounting software</strong>… if you’re in finance.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>You get my point. This software, obviously, needs UI.</p>
      
      <p>But if we carefully examine our month, we don’t interact with 3 business apps. If you’re like me, the number is closer to
        20.</p>
      
      <p>There’s nothing wrong with using 20 business applications. In fact, I believe we should be using even more software. If it
        augments us and lets us spend more time doing our core job - I’m all up for it.</p>
      
      <p>Which leads us to...</p>

      <h2 id="theriseofinvisiblesoftware">The rise of invisible software</h2>
      
      <p>Invisible software asks me for input, displays some output… and goes away. In some cases, I don’t even need to know that
        it exists.</p>
      
      <p>For example: I don’t need to love your expense reporting software. I happen to use it because I need to buy some stuff on
        behalf of my company. So there’s your expense software in the middle that helps me process that.</p>
      
      <p>But I don’t need to love your software. Maybe, I don’t even need to “touch” it.</p>
      
      <p>In fact, expense reporting software will soon run on close to zero touchpoints for most users:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>It will know when I purchased something. Automatically.</li>
      
        <li>It will receive an itemized receipt from the merchant. Automatically.</li>
      
        <li>It will know I was in a meeting with a billable client. So it will apply the expense to the client. In case it won’t know,
          it will ask me to attach a client. Semi-automatically.</li>
      
        <li>And then it will push everything to the accounting system. Automatically.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Zero-to-one touchpoint. Invisible software. Coming soon to the business near you.</p>

      <h2 id="whyslackistheinvisibilitycloakforbusinesssoftware">Why Slack is the invisibility cloak for business software</h2>
      
      <p>I believe Slack is pulling us closer to the invisible software reality. Why is that?</p>
      
      <p>At its core, Slack is a simple communication tool: you talk to your colleagues either directly or via shared channels.</p>
      
      <p>But Slack is so much more:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Ubiquitous:</strong> It’s probably the only software that everyone in the company uses on a daily basis.</li>
      
        <li>
          <strong>Used:</strong> It’s the one software that people actually check. If you want people to see something - Slack is your
          best option.</li>
      
        <li>
          <strong>Notifications:</strong> It has a very reliable cross-device notification system.</li>
      
        <li>
          <strong>Developer ecosystem:</strong> It has a good set of tools and UI components available to developers. And they’re getting
          better fast.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Let’s go back to the invisibility theory. Slack provides a platform to run &amp; interact with simple business apps. It has
        notifications, it has user presence and it has a canvas plus basic UI elements to interact with the user if needed.</p>
      
      <p>This means that a simple business app that only consists of standard HTML layout elements like forms can now run fully in
        Slack. </p>
      
      <p>It pings you whenever it needs some input. And it presents information upon request or whenever the context makes sense.
        </p>
      
      <p>The benefits are obvious:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Managers:</strong> get information from their workers that’s needed</li>
      
        <li>
          <strong>Workers:</strong> can focus on their core job</li>
      
        <li>
          <strong>App developers:</strong> can focus on reducing the interaction with users (instead of increasing engagement as its often
          the case now)</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>The app (almost) goes away. And this is as close to invisibility as it gets. Welcome to the future!</p>
