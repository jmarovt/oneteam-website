    <blockquote>“Put a man on the moon and return him safely by the end of the decade.”</blockquote>
    
    <p>This was John F. Kennedy’s famous goal for the NASA team in 1961. At the time, US was losing the “space race” against the
      Soviet Union.</p>

    <p>Looking back, this is probably the best goal ever created. Concrete, memorable, measurable &amp; simple. Even surprising
      for most at the time.</p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>What did this goal achieve?</strong>
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>NASA expanded quickly and ended up spending north of $100B in today’s US Dollars. </li>
    
      <li>NASA developed the famous Saturn V rocket. It’s still to this day the biggest rocket ever build and launched.</li>
    
      <li>Kennedy managed to rally and focus the whole nation around a single clear goal.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The rest is history. US beat the Soviet Union to the goal and Neil Armstrong became the first person to ever set foot on
      the moon in June, 1969.</p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>What can we learn from this?</strong>
    </p>
    
    <p>Setting goals and objectives is crucial. It helps us focus. It helps us say no to less important things. And it helps us
      change tactics when something is not working.</p>
    
    <p>Here’s what we’re going to answer in this guide:</p>

    <p>Many times people say: <strong><em>“Jakob, I want to start setting goals. But how do I make sure to craft good goals?”</em></strong></p>
    
    <p>It’s a surprisingly great question. </p>
    
    <p>Even though an average person now spends more than 14 years in the education system, we’re rarely thought about how to set
      <em>good</em> goals. That’s crazy!</p>
    
    <p>Setting goals is the foundation to the actual craft of work. Sure, we can easily work without goals. But the outcome of that
      work might end up being completely useless.</p>
    
    <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
      <p lang="en" dir="ltr">If you want people to take action on the data that they&#39;re collecting, give them goals. SMART goals will lead to meaningful
        actions.</p>&mdash; Vala Afshar (@ValaAfshar)

    <p>On top of it all, if we know that a modern company spends 80% of money on salaries - we better make sure we’re all working
      on the right stuff at the right time.</p>

    <p>Always start small. </p>
    
    <p>There are many sophisticated goals setting frameworks out there. OKRs for example.</p>
    
    <p>But I would advise you to just start small instead. Set and write down one to three goals each week.</p>
    
    <p>Then, at the end of each week, do a follow-up to see what you actually achieved. Without a follow-up, every goal setting
      system fails. Once you’ve mastered this, move on to the more complex goals systems.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3 id="howdoisetsmartgoals">How do I set SMART goals?</h3>
    
    <p>SMART goals is an acronym, which stands for:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>S for Specific</strong>: Target a specific area for improvement.</li>
    
      <li>
        <strong>M for Measurable</strong>: Quantify or at least suggest an indicator of progress.</li>
    
      <li>
        <strong>A for Assignable</strong>: Specify who will do it.</li>
    
      <li>
        <strong>R for Realistic</strong>: State what results can realistically be achieved, given available resources.</li>
    
      <li>
        <strong>T for Time-related</strong>: Specify when the result(s) can be achieved. </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>And that’s it. Simple, isn't it?</p>

    <p>Let's look at Kennedy’s moon goal through the SMART prism:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Specific:</strong> It's a very specific goal - put a man on the moon. Everyone can understand it.</li>
      <li><strong>Measurable:</strong> It couldn't be more measurable. You either land on the moon and document it or you fail.</li>
      <li><strong>Assignable:</strong> It was NASA's job. Sure, they got all the support and resources they needed. But ultimately it was their job.</li>
      <li><strong>Realistic:</strong> Kennedy consulted his top advisors on what would be a goal, which US would have a realistic chance in beating the Soviets to. They chose the moon landing, because it would require the Soviets to build an entirely new rocket.</li>
      <li><strong>Time-related:</strong> The first version of the speech had a deadline set for 1967. Just moments before going on stage Kennedy switched it to a more realistic timeline - "by the end of the decade".</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="wheredoesthesmartgoalsmethodcomefrom">Where does the SMART goals method come from?</h3>
    
    <p>SMART goals are more than 35 years old technique for setting better goals. The acronym first appeared in November 1981 issue
      of Management Review, authored by George T. Doran.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3 id="whydosmartgoalsworksowell">Why do SMART goals work so well?</h3>
    
    <p>While the method seems simple, it leverages a lot of powerful psychology tricks behind the scenes.</p>
    
    <p>Let’s look, for example, at the recent study done by Dr. Gail Matthews at Dominican University.
      <a href="https://www.dominican.edu/academics/lae/undergraduate-programs/psych/faculty/assets-gail-matthews/researchsummary2.pdf" target="_blank">Her research</a> proved that if we write down clear goals (in comparison to just thinking about them) we are 50% more likely
      to actually accomplish them.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3 id="whyareweintuitivelybadatsettinggoals">Why are we intuitively bad at setting goals?</h3>
    
    <p>This is perhaps the most intriguing question. We all know that goals are important and perhaps crucial to success both in
      business and personal life. Yet, at the same time, we are really bad at setting goals for ourselves and for our teams.</p>
    
    <p>What happens? Why this stark contrast?</p>
    
    <p>Well, let’s think about it. Well written goals are intuitively controversial because:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Great goals stretch our performance</strong>: If the goal is set well, we have to work extremely hard to reach it. This
        is naturaly uncomfortable.</li>
    
      <li>
        <strong>Great goals force us to say NO to some tasks and people</strong>: In order to accomplish hard goals we have to be extremely
        focused on them. This means that we have to de-prioritise some other work.</li>
    
      <li>
        <strong>Great goals make it hard to hide behind vague work</strong>: Especially in bigger organisations, individuals can become
        complacent and “hide” behind meaningless tasks, endless meetings and constant prioritisation. Clear goals put an end
        to it.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h3 id="whathappenswhenyousetclearsmartgoals">What happens when you set clear SMART goals?</h3>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Focus:</strong> It equippes teams and individuals with a simple instrument to always focus on the most important tasks
        and drop everything else.</li>
    
      <li>
        <strong>Team alignment:</strong> Let’s assume we look at a team as a set of vectors. A vector is a quantity having both magnitude
        and direction. Without a clear common goal, team members tend to work hard, but in slightly different directions. With
        SMART goals, a team naturally aligns around a goal and massively increases the sum of its vectors. To read more about
        this concept
        <a href="https://thinkgrowth.org/what-elon-musk-taught-me-about-growing-a-business-c2c173f5bff3" target="_blank">head here</a>.</li>
    
      <li>
        <strong>Teams get stronger:</strong> Team members start to bond and support each other over mutual goals. It’s much more thrilling
        to work towards a measurable goal than it is to just do yet-another-task.</li>
    
      <li>
        <strong>Individual performance becomes more visible:</strong> Letter A in SMART acronym stands for assignable. With this method,
        it becomes very clear who’s dropping the ball on a consistent basis and needs to be put on a bench.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h3 id="howcangoalsettingfail">How can goal setting fail?</h3>
    
    <p>Setting goals tends to fail when we don’t follow up on the goals. Meaning when we don’t systematically compare goals with
      what has actually been achieved.</p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>Here’s a trick to help you with follow-ups</strong>
    </p>
    
    <p>If you have a monthly goal, check your progress toward the goal on a weekly basis. This way you can adjust the tactics and
      tasks that are contributing to the goal prior to failing to reach the goal.</p>
    
    <p>This also has a positive side-effect: it pushes the whole team to collaboratively find a solution or tweak the plan instead
      of pointing fingers at each other at the end.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3 id="howcanitakesmartgoalsevenfurther">How can I take SMART goals even further?</h3>
    
    <p>Once you’ve mastered the method of setting SMART goals, you can very easily upgrade with a framework called
      <a href="/progress-plans-problems/">PPPs (Progress, Plans, Problems)</a>. </p>
    
    <p>This framework simply tells you to set up to three weekly goals (Plans), report on them (Progress) and make any external
      bottlenecks very obvious (Problems). </p>
