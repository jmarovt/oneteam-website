    <p>Customers don’t want to talk to us.<br>And whether we like this or not: it doesn’t matter.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Put yourself in their shoes: how many times do YOU want to talk to a support person?</strong></p>
    
    <p>You ever talked to someone at Netflix? Or Google? Thought so. They both work flawlessly, at
      scale. Most of us love their services and happily recommend them to friends. No support is best support, right?</p>
    
    <p>That’s not how the world works though. In reality, they both employ tens of thousands of support agents. Because people have
      ever changing needs, wishes and desires.</p>
    
    <p>What does this tell us?</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Customers can love your product and brand even if they never talk to you.</strong> When you’re the customer:
        no support is best support.</li>
    
      <li>
        <strong>On the company side, there is no such thing as no support.</strong> Every company, no matter how excellent
        their product is, has support teams. And they’re crucially important. </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The difference between the average companies and the best ones is in how they approach support requests. Is support’s main job to cover the shortcomings of the product? Or is it being close to customers, listening and ACTING on their feedback?</p>

    <p>Let’s dig into how the best product teams take advantage of their support requests.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Job #1: Categorise and tag all support tickets</h3> 
    <p>It’s important to ask ourselves: why do our customers seek help in the first place?</p>
    
    <p>A typical software product company might categorise the reasons for contacting support into 4 buckets:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>User experience (UX) issues</strong>: Customers can’t find something in our product. Or maybe they’re confused about
        how a particular feature works.</li>
    
      <li>
        <strong>Feature requests</strong>: Customers wish our product did something it currently doesn’t. These request typically sound
        like: “It would be cool, if we could…”.</li>
    
      <li>
        <strong>Bugs</strong>: This is pretty obvious. One small note though: customers sometimes report something as a bug, but it’s
        actually not. Remember to classify these request as UX issues instead.</li>
    
      <li>
        <strong>Other</strong>: Any kind of sales related question, billing questions, etc.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Here’s an example of a pie chart you might be looking at at the end of the week:</p>
    <img src="../images/content/support-ticket-product-failure/categories.png" class="frame">
    
    <p>Besides a category, I would apply a tag to each support ticket as well.</p>
    
    <p>A tag should correspond to a common theme or problem
      that the request belongs to. Let’s say we’re building an imaginary project management system. Tags there might be:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>#onboarding-problem</li>
    
      <li>#tagging-problem</li>
    
      <li>#project-creation-problem</li>
    
      <li>#user-deletion-problem</li>
    
      <li>#user-invites-problem</li>
    
      <li>#reporting-problem</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>This way it’s much easier for the product and customer support teams to spot recurring trends and decide what to work
      on.</p>
    
    <p>An example tagging system at the end of the week:</p>
    <img src="../images/content/support-ticket-product-failure/tags.png" class="frame">
    
    <p>Once you have the categorization and tagging systems in place, it’s crucial to actually use them. Educate your support staff
      on how to consistently and correctly categorise requests. Once they see that their thoughtful tagging results in product
      improvements, they’ll have no problem doing it.</p>
    
    <p>Secondly, product and support should sit down at least bi-weekly and review the metrics and trends to decide what work on
      next.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3 id="job2minimisethemostrepetitivesupporttickets">Job #2: Minimise the most repetitive support tickets</h3>
    
    <p>Let’s go back to the beginning. Customer don’t enjoy contacting you. Yet they will contact you, because no product is
      perfect.</p>
    
    <p>That’s why your product team should be responsible for owning the following metric:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Number of support tickets/customer (or user):</strong> This KPI should be trending down over time. If it does, it means
        that your overall product experience is improving.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Please note that this is only a KPI. It tells you HOW you’re doing. It doesn’t help you figure out WHAT you need to do to improve
      it.</p>
    
    <p>To find out what to change in order to improve this KPI, you need to look into the tagged support tickets from above.</p>
    
    <p>Then apply an obvious product prioritisation framework:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Which tags appear most often?</strong> Look for recurring themes - which ones keep coming up on top every week? Those
        are probably the ones you should try to address first.</li>
    
      <li>
        <strong>How long would a specific problem take to address?</strong> This is crucial. Something might seem like only the third
        biggest problem. But if it potentially requires just a new knowledge base article or a small design tweak to address
        it, you should consider working on it as the first priority. </li>
    
      <li>
        <strong>How severe is the problem?</strong> Are many customers threatening to switch to a competitor because you lack an important
        feature? That’s probably more severe than a very common, but less problematic UX issue.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      <strong>Please note:</strong> this is not a complete product prioritisation framework. It’s only useful for improving the number
      of support tickets/customer KPI. A comprehensive product prioritisation framework should take into account way more inputs
      that don’t only come from your existing customers (eg. prospects, market positioning, funnel metrics, etc).</p>
    <hr>
    <h3 id="whyminimisingmostfrequentsupportticketissoimportant">Why minimising most frequent support ticket is so important?</h3>
    
    <p>When customers keep asking about the same issue over and over again, it means that something is fundamentally broken.</p>
    
    <p>And the problem is actually two-fold. It leads to:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Frustrated customers</strong>: Remember, nobody wants to contact you. If someone does, it means they perceive the problem
        or request to be a real issue. On top of that, there are always more people frustrated with the issue than the number
        of people actually contacting you. The rest maybe found the answer to their question in your knowledge base or from a
        colleague. But it doesn’t mean they’re any less frustrated.</li>
    
      <li>
        <strong>Frustrated customer support agents</strong>: Nobody wants to answer the same questions over and over again. That’s not
        what people should or want to be doing. If your support staff keeps answering the same inquiries every single day, you’re
        both wasting their time and preventing them from providing better service to more customers.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h3 id="job3solvethecustomerrequestsasquicklyaspossibleandasgoodaspossible">Job #3: Solve the customer requests as quickly as possible and as good as possible</h3>
    
    <p>Customers have less patience than ever. Why? Modern sleek consumer products like Facebook, Netflix, iPhone have spoiled us
      all.</p>
    
    <p>And because of it - your customer support has to actually be better than ever:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>quicker,</li>
    
      <li>faster,</li>
    
      <li>equipped with context,</li>
    
      <li>and polite.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Here are some of the metrics that a modern customer support team should be tracking week over week:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Avg. satisfaction rate:</strong> How satisfied are your customers after a customer support interaction?</li>
    
      <li>
        <strong>Avg. time to first response:</strong> How quickly does your team responds to a new support request?</li>
    
      <li>
        <strong>Avg. time to resolution:</strong> How long does it take you on average from customer’s first question to the final resolution?</li>
    
      <li>
        <strong>Avg. number of replies to close:</strong> How many replies does it take on your team on average to close a conversation?
        It’s a good proxy for how much context a customer needs to provide you for you to answer her request. </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      <strong>Remember</strong>: want to improve all the above KPIs in one sweep? Then your best bet is to constantly improve the number
      of support tickets/customer KPI that we talked about before. This “organically” minimises customer frustration and gives
      your customer support more time. Time they can spend on supporting edge case scenarios, receiving valuable feedback and
      being trusted advisors. </p>
    <hr>
    <h3 id="everysupportrequestisablessingfromthesky">Every support request is a blessing from the sky</h3>
    
    <p>Didn’t you just say customers don’t want to talk to us?</p>
    
    <p>Sure I did. And yet, customers WILL talk to you.</p>
    
    <p>Product perfection is a constantly moving goalpost. Once you improve something, customers will start asking for a new thing.</p>

      <strong>For example:</strong> in the early days of Amazon, customers kept complaining about paying extra for shipping. It was one
      of the biggest friction points to more purchases. </p>
    
    <p>And then a few clever people at Amazon came up with the concept of Amazon Prime. You prepay a small amount each year and
      in exchange you get free shipping for each purchase. And you get it in maximum 2 days.</p>
    
    <p>It worked perfectly. People started to buy even more stuff on Amazon. But they wanted more. They wanted faster delivery.
      So Amazon introduced 1-day delivery. Again, it was great for a while. But then you get used to it. And you want it even
      faster. Now they are down to 2-hour deliveries in major cities. And I doubt they have any intention at stopping there.</p>

    <p>Remember another CEO who was also famous for his direct customer feedback interaction? Steve Jobs.
      <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2011/11/22/tech/innovation/jobs-excerpt-customer-service/index.html" target="_blank">Stories about his frequent email exchanges with random customers</a> have become somewhat legendary.</p>
    
    <p>And now Elon Musk is taking customer feedback solicitation a step further. He publicly responds and talks to customers on
      Twitter - on a daily basis:</p>

      <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>



    
    <p>The very best CEOs and customer obsessed companies love feedback. They know that while each support ticket is a
      failure of the
      <em>current</em> product, it is also the necessary input for the
      <em>future</em> product.</p>
    
    <p>Ignore it at your own peril.</p>
